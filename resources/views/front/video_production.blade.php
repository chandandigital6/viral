                <h2>Video Production</h2>
                <p>Video Production is not an easy task and takes quite some time as many aspects have to be taken care of. There are three main phases of Video Production:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
                    <div class="service-content">
                        <li>Pre-Production</li>
                        <li>Production</li>
                        <li>Post-Production</li>
                        <p>These points have to be explained in more detail, as they are just simple words right now and it is highly unlikely that most people would understand them.</p>
                        <h3>Necessary Aspects of Video Production</h3>
                        <p><b>Pre-Production:</b> Everything that has to be considered before the actual video-shoot comes under this section. From set-up of lights, finding location, finalizing budget to the crew and cameras. There are so many things in pre-production that a proper team is required to complete all the tasks.</p>
                        <p>Thankfully, Viral Business is a company that has it all. From Professional Cameraman to Editors, we are properly equipped to handle all your needs related to Video Production. </p>
                        <p>We have successfully helped many brands and businesses to produce videos as per their demands. Many of those videos went viral and are still remembered by general audience. That is the power that we at Viral Business have. </p>
                        <p><b>Production:</b> Production of a video is the actual recording of video using professional cameras. A director is needed to instruct all the crew members about their tasks. Director has to make sure that everything gets done exactly as it was planned.</p>
                        <p>Deciding the angles from where the footage will be captured is an essential part of Production. Capturing subject from multiple angles is a great way of showing to the audience that the video produced is of high-quality.</p>
                        <p>All the crew members present on the set have come to work and have limited time at their disposal. Viral Business makes sure that they get the most out of their time. We believe that every person must be respected as they bring a different perspective and quality to the table. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
                    <div class="service-content">
                        <p><b>Post-Production:</b> Post-Production is all about editing, removing unnecessary parts, adding text, animations, colors, and dubbing in some instances. These are the tasks that take lots of time because every detail has to be observed by the team of experts.</p>
                        <p>They have to look at each frame and find errors because Viral Business wants to deliver only the best to their clients. Post-Production is a tiresome task as it takes many hours to get the desired results. The animation is not easy in any way. </p>
                        <p>Adding colors is also a task that has to be done perfectly as they decide the tone of the video. Adding warm colors gives a different feel and adding cool colors gives a completely different perspective. All of these tasks can only happen when the team co-ordinates properly.</p>
                        <p>As all the tasks are dependent on one another, it becomes absolutely essential to work in unison. We firmly believe that when the team has a good relationship with each other, it reflects in the work. Viral Business conducts sessions regularly, where we ask for feedback and the areas where we can improve, as improvement starts with the company itself. If we start believing that we are perfect and there is no room for improvement, our downfall would start.</p>
                        <h3>Final Words</h3>
                        <p>Producing eye-catchy videos in today’s time has become essential. People do not have lots of time to read the text and would rather prefer to get the same information from a video. When videos can complete two tasks at the same time, which is to give information and also be entertaining, then why would brands prefer any other way.</p>
                        <p>Though Video Production is a time-consuming task, it can also not be ignored that all of the work that gets into it makes it worth the effort. Don’t forget that Viral Business is available 24x7 to assist you and provide you with solutions that actually work.</p>

                                <p class="faq-content">In general, the video production process is distinguished into three major phases: 1.Pre-production is the phase when our team connect to our consumers or business and examine the exact need for the video. Some basic questions are outlined i.e. who is your audience and what type of platforms do you want to publish on and many more. 2. Production- This phase includes proper filming of your video and all other filters. 3. Post-production- Once our team takes shots of your business video, the next step is the editing phase in which unnecessary content is removed & synced with proper content. </p>

We offer two ways i.e. we can either add subtitles to the video or can add a separate subtitle file that can further be uploaded on YouTube or other social media platforms.</p>
