                <h2>YouTube Channel Monetization</h2>
                <p>YouTube is getting more and more exquisite, and asks for more requirements to be able to monetize a channel on this platform. These new measures affect especially those who have started creating content a short time ago. Even some of the great youtubers have had to adapt to these new changes in order to continue making an income.</p>

                        <p>We have worked with "youtubers" who were or continue to be big stars among the global community of YouTube.</p>
                        <p><b>The most successful YouTube channels:</b> ome of the popular YouTube channels in India are those who, at some point managed to position themselves in the ranking of the most successful worldwide, understanding this success as number of subscribers. However, this our list varies and does not always include YouTube channels in India.</p>
                        <p>At the time of publication of this article, among the 10 most successful YouTube channels were the following: WWE, with 66 million subscribers. It is the YouTube channel of the World Wrestling Entertainment wrestling organization.</p>
                        <p>5 Minute Crafts counted in September 2020 with 68.3 million registered subscribers. It is a website that was uploaded to the success of DIY videos ("do it yourself") and shows how to do certain crafts or tricks for housework.</p>
                        <p>SET India, is a YouTube channel of Sony Entertainment Television India, and already has more than 82 million followers to whom it shows content for the whole family 24 hours a day. Cocomelon - Nursery Rhyme is an English channel for children, with 3D children's shorts, with 93.3 million users registered in this</p>
                        <p>PewDiePie is Swedish comedian Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg's one-man channel, which has 106 million subscribers. It is very controversial since their videos are full of profanity and content that YouTube does not allow, according to its own use policies.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
                    <div class="service-content">
                        <p>T-Series is the YouTube channel of a popular Indian music production company, known for the soundtracks they have created for hit Bollywood movies. With 139 million subscribers and more than 3 billion monthly views, it is the number one channel on YouTube right now.</p>
                        <p>From this, it is clear to us that although it is the dream of many children and adolescents to become a famous "youtuber", creating YouTube videos is not a good business for most one-person talents, but rather teams and creative companies that are taking the lead in this field.</p>
                        <p><b>How to make money with YouTube:</b> How many views of your videos and subscribers should a "youtuber" reach to get income? We already said that "youtubers" are people who are dedicated and specialize in creating content for this, and among them are many of those who are dedicated to uploading YouTube videos. They help them to transcend, to jump to fame among the younger audience, and from that they become their own brand that they can extend to others products and businesses.</p>
                        <p>Of course, this path is not for everyone: only those who have and manage to generate more than 4,000 hours of views per year will earn money with their videos. Some youtubers surveyed claimed to have taken between 6 weeks and 20 months, depending on the level of performance, in exceeding the figure of the first thousand subscribers.</p>
