                        <p>It becomes a company’s duty to observe the reviews that people post. Reviews are basically a customer’s experience when they opt for a service or buy a product. Reviews are essential for a brand as well as other people that might be considering of buying a particular service.</p>
                        <h3>Importance of Online Reputation Management</h3>
                        <p>Online Reputation Management can help your brand in many ways:</p>
                        <li>Gives you a reality check about your products and services.</li>
                        <li>You get raw perspective of your audience.</li>
                        <li>It helps you to directly interact with your audience.</li>
                        <li>Helps you to track and create a report about the average positive and negative reviews you get.</li>
                        <li>When you ask for feedback, your audience feels that your brand can be trusted.</li>
                        <p>Expansion of these points is necessary to give you a better understanding about the significance of each point.</p>
                        <p><b>Reality Check:</b> When a brand regularly produces more of their products and services, they tend to forget about the importance of getting a reality check about their services and products. It is of utmost importance for brands to observe themselves, as it can help them to improve certain sectors where they might have been lacking.</p>
                        <p><b>Raw Perspective:</b> When you decide to listen to your customers, you might hear things that you were not at all expecting. The reason for this to happen is simple. Both parties tend to look at same thing in different light. That is because of the position from which they observe.</p>
                        <p>Whether positive or negative, raw perspective of customers is needed for any business to grow, or else,they could be living in an illusion and might not get any ideas as to why their business is not growing.</p>
                        <p><b>Directly Interact with Audience:</b> Engagement of audience is a factor that cannot be overlooked, under any circumstances. After all,customers are held at top as all businesses are there because of them. Without them, there is no value as they are the ones who actually help a business to sustain in the market. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
                    <div class="service-content">
                        <p>There are countless examples of companies that collapsed because they did not pay attention to their customers. Their only priority was to earn profits. Sure, earning profits is important, but companies must not forget that they are only valuable because audience gives them value.</p>
                        <p><b>Regular Report about Reviews:</b> Creating a report about the positive, negative and total number of reviews is vital for businesses. They help to identify what all they are doing good and the mistakes they are making. That is necessary because it helps them to make decisions and remove the negative aspects completely.</p>
                        <p>Even better, businesses can work on negative aspects and turn them into something positive. And for the positive aspects, they can be left untouched or slight improvements can be done.</p>
                        <p><b>Feedback creates Confidence:</b> When you ask your customers to give reviews about your products and services, they get a feeling that your company trusts itself and is confident. When that happens, people tend to incline towards your brand, for the honesty and confidence that you show.</p>
